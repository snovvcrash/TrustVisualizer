TrustVisualizer
====================

Simple Python script that takes the output from [PowerView's](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) `Get-DomainTrustMapping` and transforms it to GraphML. This output can be visualized in any number of ways, including with the [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) project:

```
PS > Get-DomainTrustMapping | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation trusts.csv
```

The graph output will represent the access direction (opposite of trust direction).

Heaily adapted from @sixdub's [DomainTrustExplorer](https://github.com/sixdub/DomainTrustExplorer/) project. Python script for analyis of the "trust.csv" file generated by Veil PowerView. Provides graph based analysis and output.

yEd intstructions from [DomainTrustExplorer](https://github.com/sixdub/DomainTrustExplorer/blob/master/README.md) (properly parsing colors and labels within yEd's GraphML):

1. Edit → Properties Mapper
2. Add a configuration for node with a mapping for label, map to "Label Text"
3. Apply
4. Add a configuration for edge with a mapping for color, map to "Line Color"
5. Apply, Ok
6. Tools → Fit Node to Label, Ok
7. Layout → Hierarchical
